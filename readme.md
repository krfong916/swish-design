## 📦 Install

```
npm i swish-design
```

or if you're using yarn

```
yarn add swish-design
```

## 🔨 Usage

Below demonstrates a simple example of using Swish in your application:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Button } from 'swish-design';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Button type="primary">Sick!</Button>
  document.getElementById('root');
)
```

Additionally, you will need to create your own typings file. Pain in the ass, we know. We are submitting our typings to [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped), once approved you will be able to import the typing package in your project using `npm i -D @types/swish-design` or in yarn `yarn add @types/swish-design`. Using a one-line command  will reduce your workload and improve your experience, as opposed to having to create your own typings file of the components you use in your project.

For now, you'll find type definitions located under `node_modules/swish-design/lib/index.d.ts`.
- Create a folder under the directory path `node_modules/@types` and name it `swish-design`.
- Create a file named `index.d.ts`
- Copy and paste all type definitions from the located in Swish Design package `node_modules/swish-design/lib/index.d.ts` to the type definitions file you just created under `node_modules/@types/swish-design/index.d.ts`

### Content-Security-Policy

Some may be using this package with a strict Content-Security-Policy. Meaning, they cannot allow inline style tags to be injected into their document at runtime.
If your Content-Security-Policy does not allow 'unsafe-inline', one possible solution is to use Swish like so

```css
/* create a swishd.css file */
/* within the swishd.css file */
@import "swish-design";
```

```js
// in the entry point of your project
import "swishd.css";

// or if you're using a single instance of a Swish component, import swishd.css within that file
```
